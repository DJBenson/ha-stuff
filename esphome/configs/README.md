# ESPHome Configs
This directory contains ESPHome configuration files in yaml format.

Files in the [configs](./) directory are for the current release version of ESPHome. Files in the [libretiny-esphome](./libretiny-esphome) depend on the forked* version of ESPHome found [here](https://docs.libretiny.eu/docs/flashing/esphome/).

\* This version of ESPHome allows non ESP-based devices to be managed by ESPHome, including the Tuya SOC's. Refer to the libratiny website for further details.
